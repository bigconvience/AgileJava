/*
   A very simple sample program

   This program overwrites sample/Test.class (the class file of this
   class itself) for adding a method g().  If the method g() is not
   defined in class Test, then this program adds a copy of
   f() to the class Test with name g().  Otherwise, this program does
   not modify sample/Test.class at all.

   To see the modified class definition, execute:

   % javap sample.Test

   after running this program.

	return i + 1;
